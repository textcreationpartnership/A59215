            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And whereas even at this preſent (notwithſtanding the merciful providence of God, ſo ſignally manifeſted in reſtoring Vs to Our Crown, and Our pious care and endeavours to govern Our Realms in peace and tranquillity) the ſaid Abuſes do yet continue in a very high meaſure in ſundry parts of this Realm, through the buſie diligence of ſome unquiet and factious Spirits, who inſtead of preaching
<pb facs="tcp:105369:4"/>the pure Word of God, and building up the People in Faith and Holineſs, have made it a great part of their buſineſs to beget in the minds of their Heaters an evil opinion of their Governours, by inſinuating fears and jealouſies to diſpoſe them to diſcontent, and to ſeaſon them with ſuch unſound and dangerous Principles, as may lead them into Diſobedience, Schiſm and Rebellion. And whereas alſo ſundry young Divines and Miniſters, either out of a ſpirit of contention and contradiction, or in a vain oſtentation of their Learning, take upon them in their popular Sermons to handle the déep points of Gods Eternal Counſels and Decrées, or to meddle with the affairs of State and Government, or to wrangle about Forms and Geſtures, and other fruitleſs Diſputes and Controverſies, ſerving rather to amuſe than profit the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; which is done for the moſt part, and with the greateſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, by ſuch perſons as leaſt underſtand them: We, out of Our Princely Care and Zele for the honour of God, the advancement of Piety, Peace, and true Religion, and for the preventing for the future, as much as lieth in Vs, the many and great Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies and Miſchiefs that will unavoidably enſue, if a timely ſtop be not given to theſe and the like growing Abuſes, Do, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Examples of ſeveral of Our Predeceſſours of bleſſed memory, by theſe Our ſpecial Letters ſtraitly charge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you, to uſe your utmoſt care and diligence that theſe Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which upon long and ſerious conſideration We have thought good to give concerning Preachers, and which We have cauſed to be Printed, herewith ſent unto you, be from henceforth duly and ſtrictly obſerved by all the Biſhops within your Province.

            <head>Directions concerning Preachers.</head>
            <p n="1">I. THat no Preachers in their Sermons preſume to meddle with matters of State, to model new Governments, or take upon them to declare, limit or bound out the Power and Authority of Soveraign Princes, or to ſtate and determine the differences betwéen Princes and the People; but that upon all good occaſions they faithfully inſtruct the People in their bounden duty of Subjection and Obedience to their Governours Superiour and Subordinate of all ſorts, and to the eſtabliſhed Laws, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Word of God, and the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as it is contained in the Homilies of Obedience, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Religion ſet forth by publick Authority.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That they be admoniſhed not to ſpend their time and ſtudy in the ſearch of abſtruſe and ſpeculative Notions, eſpecially in and about the déep points of Election and Reprobation, together with the incomprehenſible manner of the concurrence of Gods Frée Grace and Mans Frée Will, and ſuch other controverſies as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend thereupon: but howſoever, that they preſume not poſitively and doctrinally to determine any thing concerning the ſame.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That they forbear in their Sermons ordinarily and cauſleſly to enter upon the handling of any other controverſies of leſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and difficulty: but whenſoever they are occaſioned by invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from the Text they preach upon, or that in regard of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory they preach unto, it may ſéem requiſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e or expedient ſo to do; That in ſuch caſes they do it with all modeſty, gravity and candor, aſſerting the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England</hi> from the cavils and objections of ſuch as are Adverſari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s to either, without bitterneſs, railing, féering, or other unneceſſary or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſéemly provocation.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That for the more ediſying of the People in Faith and Godlineſs (the aforeſaid Abuſes laid aſide) all Miniſters and Preachers in their ſeveral reſpect be Cures ſhall not onely diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apply them elves to Catechize the younger ſort, according as in the Book of Common Prayer is appointed; but alſo ſhall in their ordinary Sermons inſiſt chiefly upon Catechetical Doctrines, (wherein are contained all the neceſſary and undoubted Verities
<pb facs="tcp:105369:5"/>of Chriſtian Religion) declaring withall unto their Congregations what influences ſuch Doctrines ought to have into their lives and converſations, and ſtirring them up effectually, as well by their Examples as their Doctrines, to the practice of ſuch Religious and Moral Duties as are the proper reſults of the ſaid Doctrines, as Self-denial, Contempt of the World, Humility, Patience, Méekneſs, Temperance, Iuſtice, Mercy, Obedience, and the like; and to a deteſtation and ſhunning of ſin, eſpecially ſuch ſins as are ſo riſe among us, and common to the Age we live in; ſuch are thoſe uſually ſtyled the Seven Deadly ones; in ſhort, all kind of Debauchery, Senſuality, Rebellion, Profaneneſs, Atheiſm, and the like. And becauſe theſe licentious times have corrupted Religion even in the very roots and foundations, That where there is an Afternoons Exerciſe, it be eſpecially ſpent either in explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome part of the Church-catechiſm, or in preaching upon ſome ſuch Text of Scripture as will properly and naturally lead to the handling of ſomething contained in it, or may conduce to the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Liturgy and Prayers of the Church, (as occaſion ſhall be offered) the onely cauſe they grew into contempt amongſt the People being this, That they were not underſtood. That alſo the Miniſter, as often as conveniently he can, read the Prayers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and when he cannot do ſo, he procure or probide ſome fit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Holy Orders, who may do it with that gravity, diſtinctneſs, devotion and reverence, as becomes ſo holy an action: And when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever by reaſon of his infirmity, or the concurrence of other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the time may ſéem too ſhort, or he unable to perform the office of both Prayers and Sermon at length, he rather ſhorten his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe or Sermon, than omit any thing of the Prayers, leſt he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the penalty of the Act for Vniformity, requiring them to be read according as the Book directs.</p>
            <p n="5">V.

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt the infinite methods and arts of Satan wherewith in all Ages he hath infeſted and troubled God's Church, none hath proved more miſchievous and deſtructive then the perverſion and depravation of things good and holy; whereby the old Serpent playing an After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>game hath been ſo lucky and proſperous, that even thoſe things, that in their original were deſigned as means for the planting and building up of Gods Church, hath by this new artifice of the Divell, proved powerfull weapons to ſupplant and pull it down. That what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of ſin; <hi>it took occaſion by the commandment, and ſlew him;</hi> ſo the Devil hath taken occaſion by things in their firſt appointment good, to deceive, and ruine men as deſperately, as he did by heatheniſme it ſelf. It is an obſervation of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his book <hi>de unitate eceleſiae,</hi> That when the Devil ſaw his trade of Idolatry faile at the comming of Chriſt, and the Seats, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of I dols were overthrown, <hi>Excogitavit novam frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, ut ſub ipſo Chriſtiani nominis titulo fallat incautos,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105369:7"/>haereſes invenit, &amp; ſchiſmata;</hi> He deviſed a new trade of hereſie and ſchiſme, that under the colour of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he might deceive unwary ſouls, and thereby ſubvert the truth, and corrupt the faith. This new impoſture of the Divels hath been ſo operative and effectuall, daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth, That Chriſtianity it ſelf the onely true, and excellent religion, is againſt her nature made a mother of a ſpurious off-ſpring, contention, war, rebellion, The Scripture, that admirable Syſteme of divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, is polluted by the prophane uſage of every bold Dogmatizer. Every inſtitution of Chriſt is adulterated, and turned to his diſhonour. The Publick ſervice of God, which if rightly performed would come before him as incenſe, and as the Morning Sacrifice; by vain repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, extemporary boldneſſe, and tumultuary effuſions of late became the Sacrifice of Fools; the ſacred Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, that is ordained as a bond, or ligament to knit us toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in unity, is by Satans malice the golden apple of contention: an occaſion of wofull diſtraction amongſt Chriſtians, and the fuell of endleſſe and irreconcileable controverſie. The Love-feaſts uſed in the Apoſtles times for the procreation, and conſervation of charity, did ſoon degenerate into nurſeries of riot and diſſention. The Publick Vigills upon the Evens of Feſtivals,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tertul. lib.</hi> 2 <hi>ad ux. Aug. ep.</hi> 64.</note> at firſt ſo advantagious to Chriſtian piety, and obſerved with ſo much zeal and devotion, in time were changed into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like diſorders. It were endleſſe to reckon up all the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred rites of Chriſtianity, the Devil hath made uſe of, to promote his own Kingdome, and weaken Chriſts. But amongſt all thoſe, there is none more viſibly, and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly abuſed, then the Ordinance (as they call it) of Preaching, which at firſt was the organ in the hand of Chriſt and his Apoſtles for the converſion of the world: but now by Satans malice and ſubtilty is become a great
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105369:7"/>inſtrument for the diſturbance of Chriſtian Churches and Nations. That it may be a queſtion, whether the exceſſe of Preaching in later times hath not done more hurt, then the want of it heretofore. Tis certain in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, that the vice in Exceſſe, is ſometimes as oppoſite to the middle virtue, as the vice in Defect. We have lived to ſee by ſad experience, that vitious, and exceſsive Preaching, hath been both oppoſite, and fatall to the moſt excellent Church in Chriſtendome, and that diverſe and ſundry wayes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by abetting of Hereſie, Schiſme, Sacrilege, Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, Rapine, and all manner of villany. Howſoever this bullion was digg'd out of a lower region; yet it was min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſtamped, made authentical in the Pulpit. Though thoſe impes of the Devil, had their conception elſewhere, yet here they had their Birth, Legitimation, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome. From this quarter blew the wind, that raiſed the rageing of the Sea, and the madneſſe of the people. It was a ſaying of old, that <hi>Athenas oratorum eloquentia perdidit.</hi> I will not ſay, that the eloquence of our Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers deſtroyed us; but their bawling, their clamorous obſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perouſneſſe did. For while theſe Demagogues had the peoples ears tyed to their tongues, they conveyed all manner of poyſon into their hearts. They who remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the glory of the firſt Temple, know how firſt it came to be Eclipſed, and afterwards invelop'd in univerſall dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; And they who live to ſee the building of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Temple, know what mighty oppoſition it finds from the fierce and warlike nation of the Pulpiteers.</p>
            <p>Secondly by deletion, and extinction of all the parts of Gods worſhip, whereas Gods worſhip is the end of preaching, and preaching is but <hi>medium cultus;</hi> And the means is no further ſuch, then it ſerves unto the end. The matter was ſo handled, that preaching had engroſſed,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105369:8"/>and monopolized all the parts of Gods worſhip, and was become the ſole worſhip of God. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and his diſciplinarians, were modeſt in reſpect of theſe Empiricks. They allowed of no Sacraments without Sermons. Theſe made Sermons alone all-ſufficient without Sacraments. They held that the adminiſtration of the Sacraments without Sermons was damnable Sacrilege. Theſe by a more damnable Sacrilege deſtroyed the Sacraments themſelves, ſo that all the worſhip of God, was turned to Preaching much, the moſt part whereof hath been little better then vain babling.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by eclypſing and diſparaging of Gods word contained in the holy Scripture; for not only Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was laid aſide, but the Bible it ſelf was turned out of doors. The reading of the Scripture which obtained in the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Churches in all ages, and was generally found to be of ſingular uſe, and benefit, was abandon'd and eſteemed of no efficacy without ſome of their new deſcants upon it. That as the Superſtitious <hi>Rabbins</hi> proverbially ſaid, <hi>Plus eſt in verbis ſcribarum, quam in verbis legis,</hi> ſo they thought there was more efficacy in the words of men, then in the words of God: And thereupon imparted the peculiar glory of his word unto that which is not his word. For Sermons are not the word of God but equivocally, becauſe the word of God is the ſubject, and ſhould be the rule whereby they are framed. But foraſmuch as in Sermons, there is a mixture of Mans wit and invention, ſometimes a tincture of Errour and Malice; For men to lay aſide the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial and profitable cuſtom of reading the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and obtrude upon the people in the place of it, their Sermons, as the pure word of God, is a ſacrilegious diminution of its Authority. If the Romaniſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to ſo much cenſure, for ranking the Traditions of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105369:8"/>the Church in equipage with the word of God written, what inſolence is it in men to prefer their fancies and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, not only before the Traditions of the Church, but alſo the undoubted word of God it ſelf?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, by the bringing in a new kind of Idolatry; we are told of diverſe kinds of Idolatry in the Roman Church; worſhipping of Images, worſhipping of Saints and Angels, worſhipping of the Hoſt. But now there is a new kind of Idolatry brought into the Reformed Church, worſhipping of Sermons. No ignorant Papiſts idolize any Image or Saint departed more then ſome people do theſe Sermons. They adore them, they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute an omnipotency to them in ſaving Souls, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> they place their affiance in them. They go on pilgrimage with as much devotion to worſhip this imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as the Papiſts do to the Image of the Lady of <hi>Loretto.</hi> They ſpare no coſt nor charges in their obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to theſe Idol ſhepheards, though like the Idols of the Heathen they have eyes and ſee not. As the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> made a Calf in <hi>Horeb,</hi> and then fell down and worſhipped it; ſo theſe miſguided zelots ſet up Calves for their Teachers, and then fall down and worſhip them.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, by the deſtruction of the Prieſthood it ſelf; when once by this new and monſtrous Divinity they had made us believe that Preaching was the ſole and onely office of a Miniſter, and obſerved that inſolent Laicks pretending to inſpiration, could perform that well enough to peoples ſatisfaction; They ſaw there was no need of Prieſts, nor any proviſion for their maintenance, and therefore laid about them to rid themſelves of that chargeable order of Eccleſiaſticks: for which purpoſe, firſt they attempted to cut off their perſons by various injuries, oppreſsions and perſecutions; and then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105369:9"/>the Prieſthood by ſeizing upon the Church-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue. Thus they ſerved the Clergy at laſt for their preaching. As the Fox did the Crow in the Fable, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended their voices, till they got away their morſels.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, by overthrowing the ſtudy of Divinity; for ſince preaching came to be of ſuch high eſteem with the people, that they meaſure all mens worth by their ſides and lungs; many of the Clergy give over the difficulties of Theology, and content themſelves with ſuch ſuperficial knowledge therein, as will qualifie them for popular Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and no more. The Critical, Polemical, Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, Caſuiſtical parts of Divinity, crown'd with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Learning of Fathers, Councils, Eccleſiaſtical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory; in all which, or at leaſt in ſome, Miniſters ſhould excell or be competently verſed, are now laid aſide as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, and no way requiſite to the accompliſhment of a Preacher. Whence it comes to paſs, that in a Church abounding with Preachers, there is a great ſcarcity of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines. Abundance of Preachers, but few Divines.</p>
            <p>Theſe conſiderations with others have moved me to ſearch into the bottom of this art of Preaching, to ſee up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what foundation it ſtands, how it was uſed in the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church, what boundaries ſhould be ſet to it, aſſuring my ſelf it would be impoſsible ever to deliver the Church from theſe Confuſions, till Preaching, the deſign of all former Reformations, were reformed it ſelf, and reduced to the juſt rule, purged from the droſs, and reſtored to their hands to whom of right it belongs. For as in all natural and ordinate mutations, there muſt be <hi>removens prohibens;</hi> ſo that there ſhould be in moral mutations, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence dictates. If there be any thing hinders the Peace and Welfare of Gods Church, even that ſhould be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But how this can be done without the interpoſing of Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Authority, without ſome Canons
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105369:9"/>and Laws firſt deliberately made, and then faithfully exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, is not to be imagined. For though prudent and conſiderate men cannot but ſee the horrible inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that comes upon the Church by this liberty of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying, yet the Silver-ſmiths that get their living by this Craft, and have made of this preaching <hi>artem</hi>

               </gap>, <hi>the many</hi> on the other ſide, who were carryed meerly by opinion, and what they have once imbibed, hold, as <hi>Pilate, quod ſcripſi ſcripſi,</hi> they having received an opinion that this preaching is the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of all Religion; It will be more then an <hi>Herculean</hi> labour to diſpoſſeſſe them of their darling fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. It was an ingenious device of him, that to expreſs the love of preconceived opinions, elegantly painted in the gate of humane infelicity, a greater number of men in priſon loaden above meaſure, and oppreſſed with heavy chains and fetters, who yet were ſo far from grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at their miſery, that they ſtrove amongſt themſelves every one for the Prerogative of his ſhackles, while ſome licked them, ſome gently touched them, ſome meaſured them, ſome covered them with rags from the injury of the air; all gloried of their impriſonment; and if any had leſs irons then another, he envyed the others happineſs. The World is governed all by opinion, and as every Crow thinks his own bird faireſt, ſo every man his own opinion, though thereby he is miſerably impriſoned; and the fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters whereby he is holden be iron, impoliſh'd, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome, grievous to be born, yet he hugs them as Ornaments, not Impediments; as Golden Chains and Bracelets, not Iron gyves; and by them lies faſt bound in the Dungeon of ignorance: From which if a man goes about to deliver them, they complaine of ſignall injury done them, as the Devil did
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105369:10"/>of Chriſt: <hi>Why art thou come to torment us before the time?</hi> With theſe kind of men I can promiſe little ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to this paper, when I behold the huge mountains of prejudice that oppoſe themſelves to truth, and reaſon. But when I look again upon the grand Impoſtures and cheats, practiſed upon poor weak ſouls, by theſe new Quacks in Divinity; I conſider, though it be not in my power to remove, or cure ſo great an evil; yet it will be ſome diſcharge of Conſcience to teſtifie againſt it, ſome ſtep, and furtherance to the cure, to lay open the ſore, and to ſhew the neceſsity of the generous Medicaments his Sacred Majeſty hath uſed for the healing of our breaches in the Church. As certainly 'tis a thing of huge concernment for the publick peace to look unto the regulation of the Pulpit; from whence ſuch innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble evils have broke in upon us, and ſo many inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies may ariſe for the future, if there be no ſtop to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence of ſome: ſo there can be no more ſoveraign reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to prevent them then the directions of our Dread Soveraign recommended to the Reverend Fathers of the Church. I know <hi>Regium eſt bona facere, mala audire.</hi> The beſt actions of Princes are obnoxious to cenſure and calumnie. Ignorant perſons may derogate from them, malicious perſons may traduce them; but none can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound a better Catholicon for the cure of this Epidemical Diſeaſe in this juncture of affaires, then His Majeſty hath done. And I hope in this enſuing Treatiſe to make it appear to every unprejudiced Reader, that His Majeſties directions are highly prudential, and agreeable to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of ſound Theology, and the practice of the golden age of the Church. If it be demanded, why I have not confined my ſelf to them alone in the treatiſe? I Anſwer, Firſt, becauſe they being not prime verities evident of themſelves, it was requiſite I ſhould ſearch out ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent

Secondly, becauſe in this diſquiſition many Homogeneal things offer themſelves, which may be of ſome moment to the right underſtanding of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

            <p>THe firſt thing I am to treat on, is Preaching in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; And to doe that I am in Juſtice bound to give ſome account of the importance of the word: Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as words are the garments of things, and notionall words make us underſtand the natures of things. As <hi>Epictetus,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of knowledge is the conſideration of words. Now the word to Preach is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that is often rendred Preaching too, of which ſomething afterwards. But the moſt frequent, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

               </gap>. The native ſignification whereof being examined, may haply afford ſome light to the thing; And to find out that, I ſhall not ſearch into pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane authors; but ſeeing the ſtyle and language of the New Teſtament is Helleniſticall, content my ſelf to obſerve the uſe of it amongſt the Seventy, with whoſe language beſt agrees the ſacred dialect of the new Teſtament.

               </gap> deſcends. According to this ſenſe of the word in the Hebrew, and the uſe of it amongſt the Helleniſts, we find it once in our Tranſlation rendred Proclaiming, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Whatſoever is done in ſecret</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>ſhall be proclaimed upon the Houſe-tops.</hi> From this importance of the word we gaine two things.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:105369:11"/>
            <p>Firſt, that as a Proclamation is the act of an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized perſon, an Herauld or Cryer, ſo Preaching is the act of a publick Authorized perſon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that as a Proclamation is a promulgation of a Senatuſconſult, Edict, Decree, or Law, to whom it was not known before; ſo preaching is a publiſhing, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of the Goſpel to whom it was not known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as Jews, Pagans, Infidels. Howſoever through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency or pre-poſſeſsion men have not generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it, yet upon ſerious conſideration it will be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that preaching in the Goſpel-notion, eſpecially refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the Goſpel, ſignifies a publiſhing, or making it known to Jews, Gentiles, and unbelievers only. And therefore we are carefully to diſtinguiſh betwixt <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> preaching in the Goſpel imports the prime promulgation of the Goſpel to them that never knew of it; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Confirmation of them who already had received it. Preaching imports the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel <hi>de novo,</hi> where it was never heard on before: Teaching imports the inſtructing of them in Chriſtianity, which already they have profeſſed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. This obſervation I find firſt made by <hi>Gulielmus Lunicenſis</hi> in his Book <hi>de ſtatu Eccleſiae. Praedicare</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>eſt Gentiles, Judaeos &amp; Infideles, vel catechumenos ad gratiam Baptiſmi vocare; docere eſt baptizatos, qualiter contra ſuperbium humilitate,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>muniantur inſtruere.</hi> To preach is to call the Gentiles, Jews, and Infidels to the grace of Baptiſm: To teach is to inſtruct them that are Baptized, how by humility they ſhould be armed againſt Pride, &amp;c. And this diſtinction may be grounded upon the Commiſsion of our Lord and Saviour to his Apoſtles before his Aſcenſion; <hi>Go preach the Goſpel to every creature,</hi> Mark 16.15. <hi>Go make Diſciples in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the

               <hi>verò docere jam Diſcipulos redditos:</hi> This Verb in the former Verſe ſignifies a teaching of them who are ſtrangers to the Goſpel, in order to the making of them Diſciples; but the Participle in the latter Verſe imports a teaching of them who are already made Diſciples. If this be not foundation enough to bear up this Superſtructure, we are furniſhed with two Texts more by a very Learned Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> wherein this difference is viſible, Acts 5.42. <hi>They ceaſed not to teach and preach Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to teach him to the Church, to preach him to the Jews in the Temple; and Acts 15.35. <hi>Paul alſo and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord,</hi> teaching it to the Church, preaching it to Unbelievers; if any yet be unſatisfied, it will be more evident by comparing two places more in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, the one is <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.20, 21. where St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of his deſign of planting the Goſpel (ſaith) <hi>he ſtrived to preach the Goſpel,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> , <hi>not where Chriſt was named.</hi> But here we muſt take notice that the word for preaching is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> , which differs not much from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> importing a publiſhing of Chriſt <hi>de nova,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a publiſhing of Chriſt <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam bona nova,</hi> as good news is publiſhed; and if it be as news, then it muſt be to them to whom it is news. And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>he ſtrived to Evangelize where Chriſt was not named.</hi> Upon which words S. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi> obſerves, <hi>Non dicit ubi non crediderant, ſed ubi non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum nominatus eſt Chriſtus: He ſaith not where they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105369:12"/>not, but where Chriſt was not ſo much as named.</hi> The other is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. where the Apoſtle ſpeaking of his labour in inſtructing of the Churches already planted, he uſeth another ſtyle, <hi>As I teach in every Church.</hi> From this further examination of the word, and the diſcovery of the importance of it in the Goſpel-notion, another Conſectary follows.</p>
            <p>That the Preaching, which is <hi>ſub praecepto,</hi> under the expreſs command of Chriſt in the Goſpel, and is ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mentioned there, is the prime promulgation of the Goſpel to unbelievers, and of peculiar concernment to the Apoſtles; who beſides other extraordinary Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives had an unlimited Commiſsion to go into all the World, <hi>and preach the Goſpel to every creature:</hi> And ſo thoſe Texts that lay a ſtrict obligation upon the Apoſtles of preaching under the pain of incurring Gods heavy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, as <hi>Act.</hi> 4.19, 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16. are of Perſonal concernment to the Apoſtles, and to be underſtood of the prime promulgation of the Goſpel to unbelievers; and concern not us Presbyters, unleſs we think our ſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by the Commiſsion Chriſt gave his Apoſtles to go preach to the <hi>Americans</hi> and <hi>Indians.</hi> The words <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> are words of relation, relating to the ſeveral Provinces and Flocks under their charge: Though they have a duty incumbent on them of inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in Chriſtianity; yet not of preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to every creature, as the Apoſtles had; they have not thoſe extraordinary enablements of Tongues, and Miracles, and immediate Inſpiration ſimply neceſſary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that work; and whereby their Doctrine became Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick and Divine, as that the Faith of the Hearers was without further inquiry to be reſolved into it, as into a divine Revelation. In which ſenſe alone St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words are verifiable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14, 17. <hi>Faith comes by Hearing,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105369:13"/>and Hearing by the Word. How ſhall they hear without a Preacher, &amp;c.</hi> I deſire to know what man dares (the Pope excepted, to whom ſome of his vain Flatterers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to attribute Infallibility) aſſume to preach in ſuch a notion, as to make his Doctrine that, whereinto <hi>Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ſides ultimo reſolvitur,</hi> which if not, then there is not <hi>par ratio,</hi> nor <hi>par obligatio,</hi> nor <hi>par poteſtas,</hi> between us and the Apoſtles, as to the ſtrict notion and office of a Preacher in Scripture language.</p>
            <p>But whatſoever the importance of the word is in the Goſpel notion, yet now the word Preaching is become a word of Art, and is uſed to ſignifie that act of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Function, which conſiſts of inſtructing Chriſtians in their duty; and in that ſenſe from henceforward I ſhall take it, and for the more diſtinct underſtanding of the thing, make ſome little enquiry into the kindes of Preaching mentioned in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>And firſt there we find a Preaching by Inſpiration, and a Preaching by Pains and Induſtry.</p>
            <p>A preaching by Inſpiration, ſuch as I now intimated. Of this ſort was the preaching of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and thoſe who were endued with extraordinary gifts of Prophecying in the Apoſtles times. <hi>They all ſpake with Tongues as the ſpirit gave them utterance,</hi> they were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>taught of God. It is not you that ſpeake, but the Spirit of my Father that ſpeaketh in you.</hi> And the Spirit ſpeaking in them after their inauguration to their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleſhip, and Miniſtry on the day of Pentecoſt, gave St. <hi>Paul</hi> reaſon to call that their Miniſtry, the Miniſtration of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Then there is a Scripture-preaching by Pains and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, at leaſt not without it altogether. After this manner it ſeems <hi>Timothy</hi> preached, and therefore is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to give attendance to reading, and to ſtudy, to ſhew himſelf a workman, &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:105369:13"/>
            <p>Again, there is a Preaching by Writing, and a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Sermons: one that is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, another <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, one that is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, another <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, As <hi>Clem. Alexan. in lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ſtro.</hi> The Apoſtles themſelves did not Preach altogether by Sermons. By writing of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel they were Evangeliſts, and did preach the Goſpel to unbielevers; by writing of their Epiſtles, they did teach the Church, and therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth call his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> his Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Solomon</hi> was a famous Preacher; yet we are not certain that he Preached otherwiſe then by writing. The Prophets were Preachers too, but they did not preach altogether by Sermons. The Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> is commanded to write his Viſions and Revelations imparted to him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 30.2. Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith in his Preface to <hi>Iſaiah, Prophet is mos fuit, poſtquam juſti ſunt, aliquid populo nunciare, paucis ſummam rerum complecti, &amp; valvis templi praefigere: It was the manner of the Prophets, when they were commanded to deelare any thing to the people, to contract the ſumme of the matter in writing, and fix it upon the doors of the Temple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, there is a Preaching in ones own perſon, and a Preaching by Proxy. A Preaching in ones own perſon. Thus Chriſt himſelf Preached while he dwelt amongſt us, and thus the Apoſtles Preach'd where they came themſelves. Then there is a preaching by Proxy: And thus Chriſt himſelf preach'd after his Aſcenſion into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.17. <hi>He came and preached peace unto you,</hi> i. e. <hi>by his Apoſtles;</hi> And thus the Apoſtles preached, where they came not themſelves, by the Evangeliſts there ſubſtitutes.</p>
            <p>From theſe kinds of preaching I ſhall deduce two or three Corollaries more, and ſo conclude this part of my undertaking.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:105369:14"/>
            <p>Firſt, That that frequency of preaching cannot be expected from us, that was uſed by the Prophets, and Apoſtles: becauſe they preach'd by inſpiration, we by pains and induſtry only.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That men may preach in a Goſpel-notion, and yet never make a Sermon in a vulgar Notion. They may Preach by Writing, and Preach by Proxy, Preach by their Hand, as well as by their Tongue. See Dr. <hi>Holdſworth</hi> in <hi>praelect. prima, non procul ab In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, That ſeeing our Preaching is not by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate inſpiration of the Spirit, 'tis infallible, and ſubject to errour; and therefore is ordinable by our Superiours, and reducible to ſuch directions and rules as moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the promotion of Peace and Piety.</p>

It ſtands us in hand then, to know to whom this office belongs; And the examination and reſolution of this will open a fair way to the juſtification of many things in his Sacred Majeſties late Directions. But for the Indagation of this I muſt premiſe certain Principles and Maximes.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:105369:14"/>
            <p>The firſt is, that the foundation of all Authority is in Chriſt. All Eccleſiaſticall Authority, or Authority to any Eccleſiaſticall Office is in Chriſt originally; in others but Derivately. For as it was foretold, <hi>That the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhould be upon his ſhoulders, Iſa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>So that the Spirit of the Lord was upon him and anointed him to preach glad tidings, Iſa.</hi> 62.1. And this truſt which his Father committed to him, he diſcharged in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, while he was upon the Earth. He Preached the Goſpel, converted Sinners, made Diſciples: Hence he is ſtyled <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Doctor, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an Apoſtle, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>The Shepheard and Biſhop of our ſouls,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.25.</p>
            <p>The Second is, that the authority, and power neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the Government of his Church, which was inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in his own perſon, during the oeconomie of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, he did before his Aſcenſion delegate to his Apoſtles, Inchoatively, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.21, 22, 23. fully and perfectly upon the day of Pentecoſt, when by the deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the holy Ghoſt upon them, he endued them with power from above, according to his promiſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.49. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.8. But the particular delegation to this power of preaching, we have in particular mentioned by it ſelf. Once <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.6, 7. But this was limited to the <hi>loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> The generall commiſsion was given them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. In which our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour impowereth them as Planters, <hi>to preach the Goſpel to unbelievers:</hi> as Governours and Paſtors <hi>to feed his flocks, the Church.</hi> If it be objected here, <hi>That our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour granted a Commiſsion to the Seventy to preach the Goſpell, as well as to the Apoſtles, Luke</hi> 10.1.</p>
            <p>I grant it, but withall anſwer, <hi>That that was</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>temporary of ſhort duration, and to expire at their return;</hi> But this is of perpetual duration.</p>
            <p>And that's the third thing I would lay as a ground,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105369:15"/>that the <hi>Apoſtolate</hi> is of perpetual duration, though the Apoſtles taken <hi>diviſim</hi> in their perſons were to die ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after; yet taken <hi>conjunctim</hi> with their Succeſſours, as <hi>Abraham</hi> with his Poſterity, they are to continue to the Worlds end. Though the Perſons of the Apoſtles were mortal like other men, yet the Office of the <hi>Apoſtolate</hi> was, <hi>quoad ordinariam poteſtatem,</hi> ever to continue in the Church. This is evident, Firſt, by Chriſts promiſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by way of encouragement in their Commiſsion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>ult. I am with you to the end of the World:</hi> but he could not be with them in their perſons to the end of the World; and therefore, though they failed in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yet the <hi>Apoſtolate</hi> muſt continue. Secondly, by matter of fact, for when <hi>Judas</hi> by tranſgreſsion fell, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi> by the eleven was choſen to the Apoſtleſhip in his room; and it was thought in St. <hi>Peters</hi> judgment a thing neceſſary, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.20. When <hi>James</hi> was ſlain, <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were called to the <hi>Apoſtolate.</hi> And 'tis very memorable what <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> avoucheth to this purpoſe: Our Apoſtles (ſaith he) knew by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that there would be contention, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>about the name of Epiſcopacy;</hi> and for this cauſe being endued with perfect preſcience ordained the foreſaid perſons, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made a Law or order, that when they died other approved men ſhould ſucceed in their Office, and execute the Function. Laſtly, by the teſtimony of St. <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12, 13. <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, &amp;c.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>till we all meet together;</hi> and that could not be within the compaſs of that Generation wherein the twelve primary Apoſtles lived, and therefore there were Secondary Apoſtles to follow them. <hi>Lyra</hi> upon the place obſerves, that thoſe words, <hi>till we all meet, &amp;c.</hi> do denote the duration of that Office till Chriſts coming again to judgment.</p>

            <p>All the queſtion is now concerning the Perſons who ſucceed in the <hi>Apoſtolate;</hi> and we might ſuperſede that enquiry, if we would hearken to the unanimous ſuffrage and voice of Antiquity delivered to us by St. <hi>Jerome</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Marcella</hi> againſt <hi>Montanus,</hi> who (he ſaith) places the Biſhops in the third place, but <hi>apud nos Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum locum tenent Epiſcopi,</hi> with us Biſhops hold the place of the Apoſtles. Thus much is evident out of the Scripture it ſelf, that as the <hi>Apoſtolate</hi> is called by St. <hi>Luke</hi> a Biſhoprick, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.20. ſo afterwards Biſhops were called Apoſtles; which argues the identity of the <hi>Apoſtolate</hi> and Epiſcopacy. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was none of the twelve, yet called an Apoſtle <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, St. <hi>James</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was none of the twelve, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.5, 7. yet called an Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was none of the twelve, yet called an Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.25. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, thus <hi>Timothy, Titus, Clemens,</hi> and many others being Biſhops are all called by the Ancients Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. All which abundantly ſhews the identity of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary power of the Apoſtleſhip and Epiſcopacy. Theſe things being premiſed, it will be eaſie to determine to whom the Office of Preaching chiefly belongs; namely, to thoſe who ſucceed in the <hi>Apoſtolate,</hi> to them who are Secondary Apoſtles, Biſhops, as will further appear by three things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe Biſhops have the chief cure of all Souls in their Dioceſe; all Presbyters entruſted with the cure of Souls are but their Curates, and ſo were anciently called, and ſo ſtyled ſtill in our Liturgy, <hi>Send down upon our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Curates,</hi> &amp;c. in the 40. Canon of the Apoſtles. Presbyters and Deacons are forbidden to attempt any thing without the Biſhop; and the reaſon is added, <hi>nam Domini populus ipſi commiſſus eſt, &amp; pro animabus earum hie redditurus eſt rationem: The Lords people is committed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105369:16"/>to him, and for their Souls he muſt give an account.</hi> This agrees with a Canon of St. <hi>Pauls, Heb.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, for they watch for you Souls as they that muſt give an account.</hi> Who are theſe Rulers whom the Apoſtle requires us to obey? <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he ſpeaks of Biſhops (ſaith <hi>Oecumenius.</hi>) Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops then have the chief cure of Souls.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe they are concerned to ſee the Unity of the Church kept. The chief end (ſaith St. <hi>Jerom</hi>) of Epiſcopacy, was to obſtruct the diffuſion of Hereſie and Schiſm, <hi>Comment. in Titum, cap.</hi> 1. <hi>In toto orbe decretum eſt, ut unus de Presbyteris electus ſuperponeretur caeteris, ut Schiſmatum ſemina tollerentur:</hi> It was decreed in all the World, that one being choſen out of the Presbyters ſhould be ſet over the reſt, that the ſeeds of Schiſm ſhould be taken away. But how can Epiſcopacy be a deletory of Schiſm and Hereſie, if the Biſhop have not the chief power of regulating the Pulpit, and preſcribing forms of wholſome Doctrine, within which all ſhall be obliged to contain themſelves? without this 'tis impoſsible to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve either Peace or Truth in any Nation, or Chriſtianity it ſelf, which is made up of both theſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by the Titles given them in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, they are called Prophets, not of prediction only, but of ordinary Function, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.1. they are called Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. they are called Paſtors, Paſtor is the Biſhops Title (ſaith the Scholiaſt) and therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle does not diſtinguiſh them as he did the other. He hath given ſome Paſtors, ſome Doctors, but joyns them by a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſome Paſtors and Doctors; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Title of Paſtor remained peculiar to Biſhops for many hundred years after Chriſt; inſomuch that the moſt Learned Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> does challenge <hi>Moulin</hi> to ſhew him where ever it was given to a Presbyter. <hi>Eò
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105369:16"/>ergo te revoco, ut apud Chriſtianos veteres, apud priſca ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula, de eorum ſcriptis edoceas, adhiberi nomen Paſtoris, ubi de Epiſcopo non loquuntur.</hi> And if Biſhops be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Paſtors, and Doctors of the Church, to whom ſhould the Office of Preaching chiefly and primarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long but them? The practice of the ancient Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms this. In <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſtood up and made the exhortation, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Biſhop. In the 19. Canon of the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> the ſtyle of the Church ſhews this was the practice of the Church at that time, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>after the Homilies of the Biſhops;</hi> in <hi>Alexandria Soromon</hi> writes, that <gap reason="foreign">

Secondarily, the Pariſh Prieſts are to be ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the Biſhop in this; the Office of Preaching prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily belongs to the Biſhop, a ſubſidiary labour as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſubſtitute belongs to the Presbyter, <hi>Eſtius tom.</hi> 4. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>But here there may be a queſtion moved, how the Presbyter hath the power of Preaching derived to him,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105369:17"/>whether <hi>ex vi ordinis,</hi> or <hi>ex licentia Epiſcopi;</hi> by virtue of his order, or from the Biſhops licence. But granting that all Presbyters receive a power to preach by their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> yet it is onely <hi>in actu primo,</hi> not in <hi>actu ſecundo:</hi> though they have a power conferred upon them, yet the exerciſe of that power is reſtrained by the Canons till they have a Licence from the Biſhop. I have not met with any thing concerning the forms of Ordination uſed in the ancient Church, but I ſuppoſe, howſoever the matter of Ordination and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of hands by a Biſhop be an Apoſtolical Tradition, yet the form of words uſed in Ordination is not ſo, but of Eccleſiaſtical inſtitution; whence it comes that moſt Churches vary in their forms of Ordination. In the Greek Church the form is <hi>divina gratia, quae ſemper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firma ſanat, &amp; quae deſunt ſupplet, creat ſeu promovet N. venerabilem Diaconum in Presbyterum, Dei amabiliſsimum Presbyterum in Epiſcopum:</hi> The divine Grace, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes heales our infirmities, and ſupplies our wants, doth create or promote N. the Venerable Subdeacon to be a Deacon, the Venerable Deacon to be a Presbyter, the Presbyter moſt beloved of God to be a Biſhop. In the Weſtern Church they uſe another form, and in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a double power upon the Presbyter, <hi>poteſtatem confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciendi corpus Domini, &amp; poteſtatem ligandi &amp; ſolvendi,</hi> power of Conſecrating the Elements in the Sacrament of the Holy Euchariſt, and power of binding and looſing, Our Britanick Church (which is a part of the Weſtern) hath a form peculiar to her ſelf, yet very much like the old Greek form mentioned by S. <hi>Clem.</hi> in his Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 16. wherein the power of Preaching alſo is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon the Presbyter. And yet I have reaſon enough to believe that actual Preaching (eſpecially according to the common underſtanding of that word now-a-days)
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105369:17"/>is not ſo eſſential to the Order of a Presbyter, but that he may ſometimes upon good grounds be debarred from it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe if a Presbyter be ſuſpended <hi>ab officio,</hi> from his Office of Preaching, he remains a Presbyter ſtill: The Character is indeleble. Nay if a Presbyter be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended not only from the Office of Preaching, but of Conſecrating or Baptizing, or in any kind Officiating in the Church; nay, if he be excommunicated, yet his Character is indeleble, he remains a Presbyter ſtill; and whatſoever he doth by vertue of that Character is valid <hi>de facto,</hi> though <hi>contra jus.</hi> This St. <hi>Jerom</hi> proves at large in his Book againſt the <hi>Luciferians,</hi> that a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter cannot loſe his Order. And St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Book <hi>de bono conjugali, cap.</hi> 24. ſaith expreſly, <hi>Si ſiat Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatio cleri ad plebem congregandam, etiamſi plebis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregatio non ſubſequatur, manet tamen in ordinatis, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis ſacramentum: Et ſi ob aliquam culpam, quiſpiam ab officio removeatur, Sacramento Domini non carebit:</hi> If their be an Ordination of the Clergy for the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the people, although they have not a Corgregation or a Pariſh to attend upon; yet the Sacrament of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation remaines in them once ordained: And if for ſome fault any one be removed from his Office, yet he wants not the Sacrament of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe I find that the Church in prudence anciently did not ſuffer all Presbyters to Preach, but onely ſuch as were eminent for their Prudence, Gravity, Piety, and Abilities. Presbyters and Deacons, (ſaith <hi>Grotius</hi> in his Annot. upon S. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.1.) did not all Preach, but they alone, <hi>quibus docendi populum poteſtas ab Epiſcopo facta eſt,</hi> to whom the power of teaching the people was granted by the Biſhop: which Presbyters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (he ſaith) were called by <hi>Euſebius</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Presbyters entruſted with the explication of the word of God.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:105369:18"/>
            <p>Thirdly, becauſe I ſee in the ancient Church, there were <hi>Presbyteri Monachi,</hi> Presbyters Monks, Presbyters in Monaſteries, which had no cure of ſouls. St. <hi>Hierome</hi> in his Epiſtle <hi>ad Dammachium</hi> tells us of five Presbyters they had in the Monaſtery of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> on purpoſe to adminiſter the Sacrament to devout people there. Such a Presbyter was Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> himſelf, who preached not <hi>officio vocis,</hi> by Sermons, but by writing; and did, as many others, <hi>quieſcere in monaſterio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, becauſe I know the Church of England hath ordained, allowed, imployed many Presbyters, who were no Preachers. In the beginning of the Reformation ('tis well known) we had many Presbyters, that never preach'd at all. Within this 50 or 60 years, amongſt ten Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, there was not one Preacher. In our Cathedralls at this day, there are divers Singing-men Presbyters no Preachers; And Presbyters they muſt be by the rules and ſtatutes of their reſpective Churches, wherein they ſerve and attend the Quire.</p>
            <p>But if Preaching be not eſſentiall to the order of a Presbyter, what office, or duty is incumbent on him, in caſe he be not qualified, or licenſed to preach?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gulielmus Lunicenſis</hi> in his book before alledged, enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merates divers branches of the Presbyters office beſides Preaching. <hi>Praeeſſe, ſubeſſe, orare, offerre, baptizare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedicere, reconciliare, communicare animas Deo commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare, corpora ſepelire.</hi> It is his office to be ſubordinate to the Biſhop, and to obey him from the heart in all things lawful: It is his office to govern his flocks, to know the ſtate of them, and to direct them in their repentance; It is his office to pray for the people; It is his office to bleſs people in marriage; It is his office to reconcile men <hi>in articulo mortis;</hi> It is his office to communicate all the faithful; It is his office to commend the Souls of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105369:18"/>faithfull going out of their bodies to God by prayer. It is his office to bury the bodies of Chriſtian people. So there are you ſee many offices of a Presbyter beſides preaching; and thoſe not deſpicable, but honourable, and ſufficient to take a great part of a mans time in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Pariſhes. And yet preaching is incumbent on him by the Canons of our own, and the ancient Church alſo; but ſtill with this proviſo, that it be <hi>cum licentia Epiſcopi;</hi> And by vertue of that, a Deacon (as in the Church of <hi>England</hi>) may preach as well as a Presbyter. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Origen</hi> did, before he was a Presbyter. <hi>Origenes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet nondum Presbyterii gradu poſitus, ab Epiſcopis, qui ibi erant, non ad diſputandum ſolum, ſed etiam ad Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras explicandas magnopere in eccleſiaſtico conſeſſu rogatus eſt. Euſeb. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. Origen though he had not yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the degree of a Presbyter, yet he was earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated by the Biſhops who were there preſent, not onely to diſpute, but to explain the Scriptures in a Church-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly.</p>
            <p>Well then, having advanced ſo far, though with much weakneſſe, yet I hope with ſome evidence of truth, That primarily Preaching belongs to a Biſhop, and but ſecondarily to the Presbyter <hi>ex licentia Epiſcopi;</hi> There is one difficulty behind to remove, before I leave this part of my undertaking; concerning the non-preaching of Biſhops. For if they be properly the Doctors and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the Church, it ſeems altogether inexcuſable, that they preach not at all, or very ſeldome. To this I offer three things to be ſeriouſly conſidered.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that if they be hindred by Sickneſſe, old age, or ſome other natural or even accidental defects, that I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe will be eaſily confeſt a ſufficient reaſon to excuſe them from it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If they ſhall be encumbred with multiplicity
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105369:19"/>of buſineſſe in the Government of the Church (as ſurely ſince the encreaſe of Chriſtians, and the enlarging of Pariſhes and Dioceſes, they find daily more than enough,) that alſo cannot but be allowed to be a moſt juſt and reaſonable excuſe. Elſe why doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> make <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Governments an office in the Church? An office which all muſt grant is of as great uſe, as any in the Church of God, and which the ſame Apoſtle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriates to a Biſhop, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>how ſhall he take care of the Church of God?</hi> To take care of the Church of God is Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to that ſuperiour order, as the very name im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſuppoſing there be no ſuch Impediment, yet if they ſend others as their Curates to inſtruct Chriſtian people in all things neceſſary for Salvation, they Preach by their Proxies, as the Apoſtles Preached, when they came not themſelves, by the Evangeliſt. <hi>Valerius</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Hippo</hi> being a Greek born, and not skilled in the language of the <hi>Africans,</hi> could not Preach to the people himſelf, but imployed St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> being then but a Presbyter, to Preach in his ſtead; And that was then <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra morem Eccleſiae</hi> for a Presbyter to Preach in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a Biſhop; And yet <hi>Valerius</hi> was an excellent good Biſhop. <hi>Poſsidon. in vit. Auguſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, that if they write Confutations of Errours, or Comments upon the Scripture, or Directions of holy Life, as Epiſtles to their people, for the admonition of them in their duty, they Preach by ſo doing. Many of the Primitive Biſhops, becauſe they could not through diſtance of place inſtruct their people <hi>viva voce,</hi> did it <hi>per Epiſtolas Encyclicas,</hi> circular or orbicular Epiſtles; of this ſort were the Epiſtles of <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi> St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in whom are frequent Epiſtles to be found
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105369:19"/>to the Clergy and people of his Dioceſe: And of this ſort were the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Catholick Epiſtles of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>James,</hi> St. <hi>John,</hi> and St. <hi>Jude.</hi> But if none of theſe be ſatisfactory, take for a full and final an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Apology of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> a Learned and holy Biſhop, who being taxed by <hi>Keleuſius</hi> the Governour, for his ſilence and retiredneſs; In an Epiſtle told him this Parable.</p>
            <p>The Swallows upon a time derided and ſcoffed at the Swans, becauſe they did flie the converſe of men, and betook themſelves to Lakes, Rivers, and Deſert pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; were ſuch enemies to Muſick, that they ſung but little; and when they did, they ſung to themſelves alone, and no body heard them, as if they were aſhamed of their Melody: whereas they the Swallows affected the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men, and lived about Houſes and Cities, and ſung continually. The Swans at firſt would not vouchſafe to anſwer; but when they did, they thus excuſed themſelves. If any come when we lift up our wings to the Weſt, and warble out our harmonious Ditties, they may perceive, though we do not ſing much, yet our Muſick is artificial: But you make ſuch continual chattering, that you are grievous to them that hear you; you enter into mens Houſes and moleſt them with your daily obſtreperouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and this is the cauſe why you diſlike us, becauſe your ſelves are over-garrulous. Thou underſtandeſt what I mean, as <hi>Pindarus</hi> ſaith, thou mayeſt find my ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence better than thy garrulity. For Concluſion, Ile tell thee a Proverb very ſhort, but true, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>then the Swans ſhall ſing when the Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dawes hold their peace, vid. Greg. Naz. Epiſt. prima ad Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuſium Praeſidem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time the Judicious Reader may eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how many things in His Majeſties Directions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105369:20"/>the Perſon employed in Preaching, are taken out of the Archives of the Church, and derived from Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Antiquity, as</p>
            <p>Firſt, that actual Preaching by forming Diſcourſes of their own upon the Scriptures was not anciently the work of every Prieſt, being not ſimply neceſſary to their order.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that Preaching was reſtrained to the choiceſt perſons for Gravity, Prudence, and Learning.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that no Prieſt might Preach without a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that none can juſtly give a Licence to a Prieſt to qualifie him for Preaching, but the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop or Biſhop, they being the ſole Paſtors of the Church.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THe third part of my undertaking is to ſhew the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent managery of this Preaching in the ancient Church; And this thing if it were accurately done might ſerve as a pattern upon the Mount for us all to conform unto.

Now the Fathers of the Church were the firſt and beſt Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers for their Learning, for their Integrity, for their Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from ſecular Intereſts, for their Wiſdom and Zele in ſaving Souls, as appears by the happy ſucceſs of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in bringing ſo many Heathens to Chriſtianity, ſo many Chriſtians to Mortification and contempt of the World, and Martyrdom it ſelf. But to give a perfect
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105369:20"/>account of their practice (I confeſs) requires a man better verſed in Antiquity than my ſelf, who through want of time, books and other encouragements have been kept from thoſe flights which others have made into the lofty Regions of Antiquity; where the great Lights of the Church, the Stars of the firſt Magnitude, moved and ſhined: yet ſome few beams of their prudence I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, which may ſerve to ſhew His Majeſties late Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections in their genuine Colours, and render them more Illuſtrious.</p>
            <p>And one act of prudence in them obſervable, was a careful and wiſe proviſion, that Sermons ſhould not perk up into the Tribunal with the Word, and ſit in the ſame Throne with it. To preſerve the Authority of the word of God entire and inviolate, they diſtinguiſhed betwixt the word of God and Sermons. They did not call their Sermons the word of God, as now, but uſed terms of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution to denominate them by; as Homilies, Allocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Diſputations, moſtly they were called <hi>Tractatus</hi> by the Latine Fathers. Thus <hi>Poſsidonius</hi> in the life of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> calls all his Sermons <hi>Tractatus,</hi> Treatiſes; And thus St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> calls his own Sermons upon the Goſpel and Epiſtles of St. <hi>John, Tractatus:</hi> And as they called their Sermons <hi>Tractatus,</hi> ſo they called the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers <hi>Tractatores,</hi> inſomuch that St. <hi>Jerome</hi> who Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not <hi>officio vocis,</hi> ſeems to reckon himſelf amongſt the Tractators. <hi>Non ſum tantae faelicitatis, quantae pleri<expan>

It is very certain, that as they oppoſed theſe Tractators in reſpect of their Authority to the Pen-men of holy Writ, ſo they did their Sermons and Writings to the holy Scripture, which they eſteemed as the infallible dictate of the holy Spirit; but the Sermons of the wiſeſt Tractators fallible
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105369:21"/>and obnoxious to errour; And therefore when S. <hi>Jerome</hi> was taxed for reading of <hi>Origen</hi> an Heterodox Author, he excuſeth himſelf, that he read him as he did other Tractators obnoxious to errour. <hi>Epiſtola</hi> 75. <hi>adverſus Vigilant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond act of Prudence as I take it was this, that they kept the Pulpit from quarrelling with the Desk. Their Sermons did not interfere or claſh with their Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; though Preaching was frequent and had its due place and eſteem, yet it was not ſo magnified as the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy was laid aſide, or curtailed to make way for a Sermon. There was no antipathy then betwixt Sermons and Common Prayers, they did not then walk as <hi>Antipodes,</hi> contrary one to another, nor were they as contraries, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>deſtructive one to another,</hi> but did afford one another their mutual help, and walk in the Houſe of God as Friends, as may be demonſtrated diverſe wayes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by the conſtant imployment of other Officers in Gods publick ſervice beſides Tractators; Namely Deacons, Pſalmiſts, Lectors. The Preacher did not begin till the Reader had done. 'Tis obſerved in <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, Apol.</hi> 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>when the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der had done,</hi> the Preacher made the Exhortation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by the time when the Sermons came in, which was <hi>poſt recitationem Evangelii,</hi> after the rehearſal of the Goſpel; whence in after-times Sermons were called Poſtills (I conjecture) <hi>quaſi poſt ille,</hi> becauſe they were after the Epiſtles and Goſpels.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by the ſolemn ſervice after the Sermon every Lords-day. There were ever two parts of the Liturgy, the firſt and ſecond ſervice: The ſecond ſervice conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Venerable Myſtery of Chriſts Body and Bloud, and the Supplications, Interpellations, Thankſgivings wherewith it was Celebrated, which were ſtanding forms,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105369:21"/>and ſome of them derived from the Apoſtles, as <hi>ſurſum corda, aequum &amp; bonum, &amp;c.</hi> And if this Service did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly follow the Homily, then the Sermon did not ſhoulder out the Liturgy, nor the Liturgy the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, by the ſingular reſpect the moſt famous Pulpit-men had for Liturgy in general. Not to ſpeak of St. <hi>James,</hi> an Apoſtolical Preacher, who compiled a Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, as the Council of <hi>Trullo</hi> acknowledged long ago, and the Greek Church to this very day. It is well known that St. <hi>Baſil</hi> and St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> were two incomparable Preachers in their times, and yet both lovers and compilers of Liturgies. 'Tis recorded by <hi>Proclus, Patriark</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that St. <hi>Baſil</hi> and St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> finding men through ſlothfulneſs and profaneneſs begin to nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeate the length of the holy Liturgies compoſed by St. <hi>James</hi> and St. <hi>Clemens</hi> two Apoſtolical men; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted their Liturgies and made them ſhorter, that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might not through the ſubtilty of Satan apoſtatize from the Divine and Apoſtolical Tradition of Liturgy. <hi>Biblioth. Patr. tom.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 15, 16. Now let the impartial Reader recollect all theſe Arguments, and judge whether in the opinion and practice of the ancient Church, the Sermon did quarrel with the Liturgy and caſt it out of the Church? And whether His Sacred Majeſty had not juſt cauſe to take care in His Directions that they ſhould fairly correſpond and agree together, and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to enjoyn the uſe of one aſwell as the other?</p>
            <p>A third act of Prudence in the ancient Church, was the confining of themſelves and the Preachers to the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of their meeting. If it were a Feſtival, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of that Saint, in whoſe Memory the day was obſerved. If it were a greater Celebrity, the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, Epiphany, Paſsion, or Reſurrection of Chriſt;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105369:22"/>alwayes they handled ſomething fit to explain the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: If it were not upon ſuch a Feſtival day, they kept themſelves to the Leſſon read for the day. This <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſeems to intimate in the forementioned place, When the Reader hath done (ſaith he) the <gap reason="foreign">

That this was the manner of after-ages, <hi>Optatus</hi> ſignifies in his writings againſt the Donatiſts; it was the manner of the Donatiſts (ſaith he) and of <hi>Parmenian</hi> by name, when they had begun to Preach upon the Leſſons for the day, to fall from a due explication of them to the railing upon the Orthodox. <hi>Nullus veſtrum, qui non aliud initiet, aliud explicet. Lectiones dominicas incipitis, &amp; tractatus veſtros ad noſtras injurias explicatis.</hi> If the Authority of <hi>Optatus</hi> be not ſufficient, we have St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> own practice recorded by himſelf to ſecond it, who in his Sermons <hi>de verbis Domini,</hi> does not only handle the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels read, but refers to them as the ſubject he was obliged to treat on. <hi>Audivimus Evangelium &amp; in eo, &amp;c.

            <p n="4">4. To acquaint the people with thoſe parts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and the meaning of them, which moſt concern their ſalvation. For ſuch ſingular wiſdom is uſed in the Epiſtles and Goſpels for the day; that as the Goſpel lays before them the myſteries of our Redemption, ſo the Epiſtles all the Rules of holy life. The Goſpel is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of the Life and Death of our bleſſed Saviour; the Epiſtles are Inſtructions for the edification of the Church
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105369:23"/>in pious and Chriſtian Converſation. The Goſpel repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents unto us the prime Principles and Foundations of Chriſtianity; the Epiſtles contain Superſtructures upon the Foundation. And if thoſe were duly and faithfully explained to the People, the knowledge of them were ſufficient to guide them in the way to Life Eternal, and would prevent an horrible abuſe of the Scriptures by peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples petulancy in meddling with Obſcure, Prophetical, Apocalyptical parts of Scripture, which they underſtand not, and for want of underſtanding wreſt to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>A fourth Act of Prudence it was in the ancient Church, That in order to the preſervation of Peace and Piety they would not ſuſſer all men that were licenſed to preach out of their own ſtock and abilities, but required them to preach <hi>ex theſauro Eccleſiae,</hi> out of the treaſures of the Church. All men that did preach, did not undertake it of their own ſtore, of their own judgment and invention, making and compoſing Sermons as they pleaſed; but they borrowed out of the treaſures of the Church, and read the Homilies of the Fathers. Thus it was ordered in the Council of <hi>Vaſe, can.</hi> 4. Power being granted to the Presbyters to preach in every City; in caſe they were hindered by any infirmity, the Deacons were enjoyned to read the Homilies of the Fathers, <hi>Sanctorum Patrum Homiliae recitentur.</hi> And the reaſon follows; <hi>Si enim digni ſunt Diaconi quae Chriſtus in Evangelio locutus eſt le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere, quare indigni judicentur ſanctorum Patrum expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones publicè recitare?</hi> If the Deacons be worthy to read the Goſpel of Chriſt, why ſhould they be thought unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to rehearſe publickly the Expoſitions of the Fathers? And this gives us ſome ground of conjecture, that the Presbyters read Homilies of the Fathers too; for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not onely Deacons and Presbyters, but even Biſhops
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105369:23"/>themſelves did ſo. <hi>Gennadius</hi> in his book <hi>de illuſtribus Eccleſiae ſcriptoribus</hi> teſtifieth, that <hi>Cyril</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> had written Homilies, which many Fiſhops of <hi>Greece</hi> uſed afterwards: <hi>Cyrillus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Alexandrinae Eccleſiae Epiſcopus Homilias compoſuit plurimas, quae ad declamandum à Graecis Epiſcopis memoriae commendantur; cap.</hi> 57. <hi>Sixtus Senenſ. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 222. <hi>Cyril</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> compoſed many Homilies, which the Greek Biſhops getting by heart preached unto the People. This may haply ſeem a diſhonourable thing to ſome men to be thus limited; but if it may tend to the peace of the Church, it ought not to be grievous. How requiſite ſome ſuch Order is in this Church, where ſo many are imployed in Preaching, who through faction do <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, make merchandiſe of the Word of God, or through want of Learning turn Plagiaries, and do <hi>vivere ex rapto,</hi> preach Sermons in Print, and oftentimes according to their prepoſſeſsions take the worſt, and leave the beſt; is eaſie to diſcern: For had they not better be appointed where they ſhould borrow ſtuff for their weekly tasks, be limited and confined to the Homilies of the Church, and the Fathers of the Church; than be ſuffered to rake into the kennels of Faction and Schiſm, out of which they firſt ſuck poiſon themſelves, and then propine it to their hearers?</p>
            <p>A fifth Act of Prudence in the ancient Church was, A wiſe Accommodation of themſelves to the capacity of their hearers, avoiding in their Sermons the diſcuſsion of ſublime and ſubtil Queſtions, which conduced not to the Edification of their Auditory: They generally diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed betwixt <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, things to be publiſhed and things to be kept ſecret: they did not think it meet to publiſh all the myſteries of Chriſtianity to them who were not <hi>Initiati,</hi> Initiate in the ſchool of Chriſt, as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105369:24"/>Heathens, &amp;c. Neither did they judge it expedient to handle high and difficult Queſtions before the unskilful Multitude, though <hi>Initiati,</hi> Initiate in the ſchool of Chriſt; but condeſcended in their Sermons to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Vulgar. From hence it was that they called their Sermons Homilies: An Homily is a familiar Sermon or Speech, accommodated to the ſenſe and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Vulgar. It is a memorable and grave ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> recorded by <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de vita Conſtant. cap.</hi> 67. Such Queſtions as no Canon or Law of the Church hath preſcribed, but are the products of diſſolute Idleneſs, though they may ſerve to exerciſe the ſharpneſs of the wit, we are to lock up in the cloſet of our Breaſts, and neither raſhly broach them in the Conventions of the People, nor inconſiderately commit them to the ears of the People. For what man is there amongſt many that can accurately underſtand them, or worthily explane the meaning of ſuch Myſteries involved in ſo much obſcurity? And if any man be ſo conceited of himſelf, as he thinks he can do it; who are they amongſt the People that can underſtand them? Or who is he at length who can meddle in the indagation of ſuch curious Queſtions without danger of Lapſing? Wherefore Loquacity in ſuch things is to be reſtrained, leſt that we either through imbecillity of wit fail of the true explication of them, or the hearers through the tardity of underſtanding come ſhort of a right apprehenſion of them, and ſo fall into a neceſsity or blaſpheming, or diſſention among themſelves. So far the Emperour. And that Rule of Prudence he commends, was carefully obſerved by the Ancients in their popular Sermons. <hi>Gregory Nyſſen</hi> writes of his Father <hi>Baſil,</hi> in the beginning of his <hi>Hexameron,</hi> that he did not <hi>Verborum contentiones aucu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pari, nec facilè ſeſe quaſtionibus implicabat, ſed ſimplici
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105369:24"/>verborum expoſitione audientium ſimplicitati ſic orationem ſuam accommodabat, ut variam tamen externae philoſophiae doctrinam redolens peritioribus etiam ſatisfaceret: Latin. edit. pag.</hi> 284. <hi>excuſ. anno</hi> 1562. The ſumme whereof is this, that he did not ſeek after contentions of words, nor lightly involve himſelf in hard Queſtions, but by a ſimple expoſition of the Text applied himſelf to the capacity of the hearers. <hi>Metaphraſtes</hi> writes of S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> that having once ſoared aloft in a Sermon above the reach of his hearers, a certain woman met him, and reprehended him openly for his unprofitable Sermon, which being above her underſtanding, ſhe had not gained that by it ſhe expected at her coming: Whereupon that holy Father afterwards deſcended from that ſublimity of matter to ſuch ſimplicity and plainneſs in the courſe of his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he might be underſtood of all that heard him; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Savil. pag.</hi> 383, 384. He reſolved to apply himſelf to the inſtruction and care of the weak. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his 11. Sermon <hi>de verbis Domini,</hi> treating of the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, ſaith, <hi>Semper in Sermonibus quos ad populum habui, hujus quaeſtionis difficultatem moleſtiám<expan>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> vitavi:</hi> Always in my Sermons which I had to the People, I avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that difficult queſtion. And in 157. <hi>Epiſt. ad Opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> touching upon that nice queſtion, <hi>Whether the Souls were traduced by generation, or infuſed by creation?</hi> he writes, <hi>In tam multis opuſculis meis, nunquam me fuiſſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum de hâc quaeſtione definitam proferre ſententiam;</hi> In ſo many Works of mine, I never durſt publiſh my Opinion in that point. Thus for the matter of his Doctrine, this Father was careful it ſhould not conſiſt of Curioſities; and ſo he was for the manner of his Style, whence he had that as a Proverb in his mouth, <hi>Malo ut me reprehendant Grammatici, quam non intelligant populi: Sixtus Senenſ. lib.</hi> 4.205.</p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:105369:25"/>
            <p>If any ſhall object, That S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> notwithſtanding this in his books <hi>de bono perſeverantiae</hi> does contend ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly for the preaching of Predeſtination, a profound, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, and abſtruſe point of Divinity.</p>
            <p>That this may ſeem no diminution to the prudence of the ancients, I return three things by way of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That he does it with ſome limitation, where the Auditory were capable of it. He would not have it preach'd promiſcuouſly to all. <hi>Dicatur ergo verum, max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imè ubi aliqua quaeſtio ut dicatur impellit, et capiunt qui poſſunt. Facile eſt enim, imo ſtabile, ut taceatur aliquod verum propter incapaces. Nam utile eſt illud domini, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huc multa habeo vobis dicere, ſed non poteſtis iſta portare modo; et illud Apoſtoli, Non potui vobis loqui, quaſi ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talibus, ſed quaſi carnalibus.</hi> Let truth be ſpoken, when neceſsity requires it, and men are able to receive it. It is obvious that, and certain, that ſome truth is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed for the incapacity of the hearers. For that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, which our Lord and Saviour ſaith, <hi>I have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things to ſay unto you, but you cannot bear them now:</hi> And that of the Apoſtle, <hi>I could not ſpeak unto you as unto Spiritual, but as unto Carnal, even as unto Babes in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s deſign was not to have the ſpeculative part of Predeſtination preach'd, or that abyſs of Gods counſell dived into; but to have the effect of that decree, as he had conceived on't, maintained in Sermons; namely Free grace; that grace was not given <hi>ſecundùm merita.</hi> For we muſt know, that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was ſingular in uſing that weapon of Predeſtination againſt the Pelagians for the defence of Grace. He defined Predeſtination to be a preparation of Grace, and Grace to be an effect of Predeſtination; and thereupon opin'd,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105369:25"/>that they mutually inferr'd one another, and that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſever Free grace was preach'd, Predeſtination was preach'd alſo. This is evident by an ocular demonſtration in that book of the Fathers: for he avoucheth conſidently, That St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> preach'd Predeſtination in thoſe words, <hi>In nullo gloriandum eſt, quando noſtrum nihil eſt.</hi> We muſt glory in nothing, becauſe nothing is ours. <hi>His Cypriani verbis proculdubio praedeſtinatio praed catur.</hi> In thoſe words (ſaith the Father) of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> without all doubt Predeſtination was preach'd; by this it ſhould ſeem, that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> onely intended the preaching of Free grace. But whatſoever his intention was, and how innocent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his meaning, yet,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I anſwer, That this was apprehended in S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> as a great Novelty, not onely by the <hi>Maſsilians,</hi> who ceaſed not to clamour againſt him for it; but by them alſo who were as great Aſſertors of all kinds of Grace in oppoſition to the Pelagians, as he himſelf. For thus ſaith <hi>Hillary,</hi> The Orthodox complain, what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity was there <hi>hujuſmodi diſputationis incerto, tot minùs intelligentium corda turbari? &amp;c.</hi> That the minds of ſo many Chriſtian people ſhould be troubled with this doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſputation. The Catholick Faith hath been defended ſo many years, by ſo many Tractators, by ſo many books of yours and others, as well againſt other Hereticks as againſt the Pelagians, without this Definition. And <hi>Proſper</hi> in an Epiſtle to S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> complained, that the <hi>Maſsili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> charged this Doctrine of Predeſtination with contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety to the Doctrine of the Fathers before, and the ſenſe of the Church. And again, <hi>obſtinationem ſuam vetuſtate defendunt,</hi> they defend their obſtinacy by Antiquity.

Happy was the Chriſtian World when the Pulpit was delivered from the perplexities of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and ſo it remained for the ſpace of three or four hundred years, till <hi>Gotteſchalk,</hi> an irregular Monk in <hi>France,</hi> out of his Hypocondriack Zele fell a preaching it amain, and thereby raiſed a new violent ſtorm in the Church, which for the ſpace of eleven years miſerably toſſed, rent and ſhaked the Ark of Chriſts Church, even to the danger of ſhipwreck. <hi>Gotteſchalk</hi> himſelf eſcaped not the fury of the Tempeſt, for by two Synods he was condemned, one at <hi>Mentz,</hi> another at <hi>Rhemes;</hi> and when in the laſt he malapertly behaved himſelf towards the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops there, he was ordered to be whipp'd; and, leſt he ſhould draw away Diſciples after him, he was committed to priſon.

It is an high act of Imprudence certainly, that thoſe moſt abſtruſe Myſteries ſhould be handled openly in the Pulpit, as if the life and ſoul, the ſubſtance of Chriſtianity conſiſted in them alone. And a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he ſaith, That there were two things very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted the Batavian Churches, <hi>Nimium acumen, &amp; nimia prophetandi libertas;</hi> Too much Curioſity, and too great liberty of Propheſying. I wiſh to God the Britannick Churches had not cauſe to complain of theſe evils alſo: But if we look upon the preſent face of things, or trace our late Confuſions to the original, we ſhall find that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Propheſying and Dogmatizing about Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath had no ſmall influence into our miſeries. Juſt cauſe then had His Sacred Majeſty to ſet bounds to the Liberty of Propheſying, and to prohibit the itch of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputing or handling thoſe high ſpeculations of Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees in popular Sermons; from which, as from a ſource or fountain, ſuch waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> and waters of <hi>Meribah,</hi> of Contention, have continually flowed. And moreover, to confine Preachers to Catechetical Doctrine, more fit to edifie men in faith and holy life; as the manner was in former times. <hi>Lindwood</hi> tells us in <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de officio Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaconi,</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:105369:28"/>That the Arch-deacon by his office was to ſee, that every Presbyter, who had a cure of ſouls, ſhould preach to his people the Articles of the Apoſtles Creed, the Ten Commandments, the Two Commandments of Love, and againſt the Seven deadly Sins, &amp;c. And if people would ſtill content themſelves with ſuch ſalutary Doctrine, and Miniſters would confine themſelves to ſuch ſafe and profitable Divinity, no doubt but truth and piety would flouriſh, and abundance of peace, ſo long as the Moon endureth.</p>
            <p>The ſixth and laſt act of prudence I ſhall mention, was their conſtant and faithful preaching of obedience to all ſuperiours in Church and State; whereby they kept the people in an admirable ſubordination; gained a huge repute to Chriſtianity, and prevailed much upon the gainſaying world. For ſuperiors in the Church, they taught people to be ſubject to their Prieſts, and both Prieſt and People to their Biſhop; and that with ſo much zeal and earneſtneſs, that tis wonderful to ſee how St. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> (a holy Martyr, and a Father contemporary with ſome of the Apoſtles, and one of thoſe 500 that ſaw Chriſt in the fleſh after his reſurrection) in his genuine Epiſtles does in every page almoſt inculcate this Doctrine of peoples Subjection to their Deacons, Prieſts, and Biſhops. And St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> who when angred, though touchy, and ſomething unequal to that ſuperiour order; yet when pacifick, and undiſturbed, how gravely does he admoniſh his Friend <hi>Nepotian</hi> to be ſubject to his Biſhop, and to receive him as the parent of his ſoul; ſeeing what <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons were in the time of the Law, that the Biſhop and his Prieſts are in the time of the Goſpel?</p>
            <p>For their ſuperiors in the State, they taught as St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Peter, Chriſtian people to be Subject to the higher
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105369:29"/>powers for the Lords ſake;</hi> not onely when they were Chriſtians, but when they were Heathens, Tyrants, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors of Chriſtians; And this they did, when Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were numerous, and ſtrong enough to have caſt off the yoke of obedience, if it had been lawful. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd Rebellion, not onely as inconſiſtent with Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, but alſo deſtructive to the doctrine of the croſs; whereby it came to paſs, that inſtead of raiſing an army of Rebels againſt their Emperors, they raiſed an holy army of Martyrs, who reſiſted unto bloud ſtriving againſt ſin, and by their bloud did ſow the ſeeds of Chriſtianity, and conquer'd the Heathen World. Their Doctrines to this purpoſe are collected by <hi>Hugo Grotius, de jure belli, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. I ſhall therefore ſuperſede the trouble of preſenting the Reader with thoſe luculent teſtimonies, and onely inferr from hence, How much Miniſters are beholding to His Sacred Majeſty, for calling them out of their by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paths and new wayes, into the good old ways wherein the Apoſtles, and Apoſtolical preachers walked; in taking all occaſions faithfully to inſtruct Chriſtian people in their bounden duty of ſubjection and obedience to their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, ſuperiour, and ſubordinate of all ſorts. And how much Chriſtianity it ſelf owes to his Majeſty for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care that no fowle ſpots by the Antichriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of rebellion, ſhould be caſt upon the face of that beautiful Virgin.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>What Innovations have been introduc'd in theſe latter times.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe fourth and laſt part of my undertaking, Is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit a Scheme of ſome Innovations introduced con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning preaching. It cannot be denyed, but preaching hath arrived to as much perfection amongſt us in this Church, as in any Church of Chriſtendome: ſince the Knowlege of arts and tongues have flouriſhed, and artificial methods have been deviſed, and theſe improved by ſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent practiſe, many have approved themſelves excellent preachers. But as time and chance happen to all things: ſo they have done to this preaching. By the lovers of novelty and change, ſome acceſsions have been made to this practiſe, which have much altered the face, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of it. And though people diſcern them not when once made legitimate by general cuſtom and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; yet ſurely as <hi>Tertullian, quod primum verum,</hi> and as St. <hi>Hierom, ſine iſtis mundus Chriſtianus fuit.</hi> The world was Chriſtian without theſe for the ſpace of 1500 years, and ſo may be ſtill. It would be too long to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate all the Novelties of this kind, that are inſenſibly crept in upon us, and inſiſt upon them at large. As <hi>profanas</hi> as <hi>vocum novitates,</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> admoniſheth us to avoid; the affectation of new forms of words, cant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing language, &amp;c. The preaching ſometimes half a year upon a text, nay upon one Doctrine ſometimes. The cogging of doctrines out of a text <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by ſleight of hand, as Gameſters do their Dice to cheat, and deceive. Theſe and many more might be rehearſed; But I ſhall
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105369:30"/>onely inſiſt upon ſome few, which are more general, and of dangerous conſequence.</p>
            <p>And one of theſe, I take to be the uſe of conceiving long prayers of our own before Sermon. A thing ſo novel, that howſoever it be looked upon as an eſſential part of a Sermon, and finds general favour, and patronage amongſt the many; yet it is but of yeſterday; born into the world ſome years ſince the Reformation it ſelf, and can ſcarce yet write fourſcore years old. It were happily prejudice enough againſt this uſage, that in a Church where Liturgy is eſtabliſh'd for Gods publick worſhip, and a Liturgy ſo well ſtored with Divine and Heavenly Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects for all occaſions neceſſary, theſe Pulpit-conceptions are altogether needleſs. But beſides this, if it be brought to the touch, it will be found a meer novelty. For whereas the great Patrons of this Liberty, pretend Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-antiquity for all they do, here they are at a loſs, and can ſhew neither Command nor Example to juſtifie their practiſe. There is no Command for it in the Goſpel, nor any Example of Chriſt or his Apoſtles: though there be many of their Sermons upon Record, yet no mention of any praying before them: Nay, which is more, there is no Church-antiquity for it neither. I know tis avouch'd by ſome very learned men, as <hi>Ferrarius de ritu concionum, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> in his book of religious aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>pag.</hi> 228. <hi>That the Fathers begun their Homilies with prayers;</hi> But what manner of prayers were they? Some <hi>vota pacis,</hi> or benedictions of the people, or implorations of Gods aſsiſtance in ſome ſhort ejaculations. <hi>Ferrarius</hi> exemplifieth in the practiſe of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who begun and ended his Epiſtles with ſhort prayers; And moreover teſtifieth, that the Fathers uſed ſuch kind of prayers, not onely in the beginning of their Sermons, but ſometimes in the midſt of them alſo: when they were
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105369:30"/>about to treat of a matter of difficulty, they did in a ſhort prayer implore Gods aſsiſtance, as may be ſeen frequently in the Homilies of S. <hi>Chryſoſtom. Ferrar. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 23. There is a prayer ('tis confeſs'd) that S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> uſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Sermon extant, but it was a ſhort prayer, a form of prayer conſtantly uſed without variation: And there is ſomething may juſtifie S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in this practice, which extends not to all; he was an Archbiſhop, and inveſted with power to regulate and order the publick prayers of the Church in all his Dioceſe, and ſo had ſingular Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to compoſe a Collect for himſelf upon ſome exigent of the Church. It will not follow from hence, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry green-headed fellow may take a liberty of conceiving prayers before his Sermon thirty or forty times as long as S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s prayer was, and very every Lords day, nay twice a day ſometimes, and obtrude thoſe upon the World as all the Common prayers requiſite in a Church.</p>
            <p>But they have another Plea (I ſee in Mr. <hi>Bernard</hi>) for the Antiquity of theſe Conceptions before Sermon, from the Authority of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who in his fourth book <hi>de Doctrina Chriſtiana cap. 3.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Si enim regina Eſther oravit pro ſuae gentis temporaria ſalute loquutura apud regem, ut in os ejus Deus congruum ſermonem daret; quanto magìs orare debet, ut tale munus accipiat, qui pro aeterna hominum ſalute in verbo &amp; doctrina laborat?</hi> If Queen <hi>Eſther</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the temporal ſafety of her Nation, when ſhe was to ſpeak before the King, that God would put into her mouth congruous words; how much more ought he to pray for ſuch a gift, who labours in the Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine for the eternal ſalvation of Mens ſouls? But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> intend publick or private prayer is not here expreſt. 'Tis certain <hi>Eſthers</hi> prayer was private. If publick prayer, whether he intends a prayer of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105369:31"/>Churches compoſing, or of our own conceiving, is not mentioned. In the 15. <hi>cap.</hi> of the ſame book we have another paſſage to the ſame purpoſe; <hi>Ipſa jam hora ut di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat accedens, priuſquam exerat proferentem linguam, ad Deum levet ſitientem animam:</hi> The hour being come that he ſhould ſpeak, before he opens his mouth, let him lift up his thirſting ſoul. But this may be done by a mental prayer, and it ſeems the Father ſpeaks of that; for he ſaith, Before he makes uſe of his tongue, let him lift up his thirſting ſoul. That he could not intend a publick vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal prayer, I think is manifeſt by the 12. Canon of the Milevitan Council, wherein S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelf was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, when it was by him and other Fathers decreed, That no prayers ſhould be uſed in the Church, <hi>Niſi quae à pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentioribus tractatae, vel comprobatae fuerint in Synodo, nè fortè aliquid contra fidem per ignorantiam vel per minus ſtudium ſit compoſitum:</hi> But ſuch as were firſt examined by the more prudent, or appointed in an open Synod, leſt haply ſomething againſt the Faith, either through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or careleſneſs, fall from any. If any man queſtion whether S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> were preſent in this Council, and had a hand in this Canon, let him hear what <hi>Micrologus</hi> ſaith, <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>de authenticis or ationibus; Nam octavum Africanae provinciae concilium (cui ſanctus Auguſtinus, immo ducenti &amp; quatuordecim ſancti Patres interfuerunt) cap.</hi> 12. <hi>ita conſtituit, Nullae preces vel orationes dicantur, niſi quae in concilio fuerint probatae:</hi> The eighth Council of the Province of <hi>Africa</hi> (wherein S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and two hundred Fathers more were gathered together) ordained, That no prayers ſhould be uſed, but ſuch as were approved of in the Council. And the third Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> wherein S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alſo was preſent, made a Canon to the ſame purpoſe. If S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelf, and ſo many Fathers in two Councils, interdicted the uſe of all pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105369:31"/>in publick, but ſuch as were approved of in open Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod; then S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> cannot be underſtood of prayers of our own conceiving, but either private prayers, or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick prayers of the Churches compoſing. It is no vain conjecture therefore of <hi>Walafridus Strabo</hi> upon S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> own practice; for he obſerving that S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> concluding many of his Homilies with this clauſe, <hi>Converſi ad dominum,</hi> uſed to ſubjoyn a Common prayer, <hi>Sicut etiamnum ſolent ſacerdotes in concluſionibus nocturnae vel diurnae Synaxews orationes breves &amp; collect as ſubjungere: Strabo</hi> 22. In <hi>Strabo</hi> his judgment then it was nothing but a ſhort Collect, ſuch as the Prieſts uſed in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Nocturnal or Diurnal Office.

            </p>
            <p>This was S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> prayer he concludes his Sermon withall ſometimes; and yet if it be obſerved, it is no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal prayer, but an invitation to prayer, a Bidding prayer,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105369:32"/>like that in our Canons. Bidding prayers, it ſeems, were in uſe before ours in the Canon. I wiſh to God that theſe later Ages had contained themſelves within the bounds and limits of his ſobriety and modeſty, we ſhould have had no cauſe then to complain of the innumerable evils occaſioned by the abuſe of this Liberty: As,</p>
            <p>Firſt, the hiding and concealing the beauty of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy from the common people, which had ſhined as il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtriouſly as the Sun at noon-day, had not this novel uſage (as the Moon) interpoſed it ſelf betwixt it and their ſight: Though all men that took up that faſhion did not foreſee the evil, nor intend it; Yet this was clearly the event and the deſign alſo of thoſe Empiricks, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to a peculiar gift of prayer, and praying by the Spirit; for if they were guided by the Spirit in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and the Church not guided by the Spirit in her ſolemn Forms, what elſe could follow in the peoples Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, but that the Common prayers of the Church were vain and ſuperfluous?</p>
            <p>Secondly, the diffemination of Falſe Doctrine. S. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> obſerves <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 81. that there are many <hi>Haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes affectum erroris, cum praedicandi eundem non habent li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertatem;</hi> Love errours, that have not liberty to preach it: And becauſe they have not liberty to preach it, by this new arrifice they learn to pray it, broach all manner of falſe Doctrine in their prayers. If the prayers of theſe men be not looked into as well as their Sermons, they'l pray all into confuſion, the King out of his Throne, Peace and Truth out of the Church, and People out of their Wits.</p>
            <p>A third evil comes by this Liberty, is ſingular diſhonour to God, and ſcandal to Chriſtian People. For the moſt Seraphick of theſe men, when they venture upon extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary prayers, happen to loſe themſelves oftentimes;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105369:32"/>and that their imperfections may not be diſcerned, they have an art to fill up the chaſmes with Humms and Haws, which the poor people are made to beleeve are the groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Spirit; or elſe with miſerable tautologies, or which is worſe, execrable blaſphemies. If all the nonſenſe and blaſphemy were gathered together, which have faln from men in their effuſrons of late time, they would make a volume as great as <hi>Thomas Aquin as ſumms.</hi> I ſhall <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>Was there euer ſuch unclean unhallowed ſtuff brought into the Sanctuary? did the Jewes when they were moſt profane, pollute the great name of God with ſuch lame and maimed ſacrifice? did ever the Heathen invoke their falſe deities in ſuch a rude and barbarous manner? who took care, <hi>ne quid praepoſterè dicatur.</hi> Let all ſober and prudent men judge, whether theſe look like dictates of the Spirit.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105369:33"/>to ſpeak wiſely and ſententiouſſy? And does it now teach men to play the fool, and pray like mad men? Let men conſider whether theſe deformed conceptions be comparable to the grave and ſolemn praiers of the Church, the production of 1500 years wiſdome and experience; or whether it be fit to leave men to their liberty of praying in publick, when they have thus abuſed it to their own ſhame, to the ſcandal of people, and the infinite diſhonour of God.</p>
            <p>Another Innovation it ſeems to me, is the Preaching of very young men out of their own ſtocks and abilities. Amongſt the Jews none were privileged to decide mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Controverſie in the Law, till they were learned in the School of a Doctor, and forty years of age. Our Lord and Saviour Chriſt, and <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> begun not to preach till they were thirty years of age: For which cauſe the Church afterwards in ſeveral Canons forbad that any ſhould be made a Presbyter till he was thirty years of age. The Canons are extant in <hi>Gratian. diſtinct.</hi> 78. I ſhall name onely the 11. <hi>Can.</hi> of the <hi>Neocaeſarian</hi> Council. <hi>Presbyter ante triginta annorum aetatem non ordinetur, quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis ſit probabilis vitae; ſed obſervet uſque ad praefinitum tempus. Dominus enim trigeſimo anno babtizatus erat, &amp; praedicavit.</hi> Let no Presbyter, though he be of a good life, be ordained, till he be thirty years, but let him wait till the time appointed. For our Lord and Saviour was baptized the Thirtieth year of his age, and then began to Preach. If there were no Canon upon Record to atteſt the ſenſe and practiſe of the Church; yet the very title of Presbyter, which belongs to men of that order, were enough to doe it. For the word Presbyter is not onely <hi>Nomen</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a name of dignity, but of age; and infinuates, that they were all men of years ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into that order. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in the life of St. <hi>Jerom</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:105369:34"/>teſtifieth, that when <hi>Paulinianus</hi> Brohter to St. <hi>Hierome</hi> upon his ſingular merit was made Presbyter, before thoſe canonical years, <hi>Hoc nomine poſteà calumniam ſtruxit Jeronimo Joannes Hieroſolymitanus, quod infra legitimam aetatem, ad hoc honoris eſſet evectus, olim enim ante triceſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum annum nullus erat maturus honori Presbyteri.</hi> John B. of Jeruſalem afterwards went about to detract from S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> becauſe his Brother was promoted to that order being under age: For anciently (ſaith he) before the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year, none were ripe for the honour of a Presbyter. In which words <hi>Eraſmus</hi> acknowledgeth both the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of that cuſtome of the Church, and the great cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure St. <hi>Heirom</hi> lay under, for promoting or ſuffering his Brothers Ordination before the legitimate age. And though happily our Church in the beginning of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation through ſcarcity of men to ſerve in thoſe Sacred offices, was forced to abate ſomething of the rigour of thoſe Canons, and admit men into the order of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, before they were arrived to that maturity of years; yet there was no neceſsity of ſuffering them to preach <hi>ex proprio,</hi> out of their own ſtocks and abilities. If in the ancient Church, where none were Presbyters till they were thirty years of age, all Presbyters were not ſuffered to preach, but only ſuch as gave good ſecurity for the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent managery of the office; it may ſeem an overſight to ſuffer young men to preach, and then leave them to their liberty in preaching. The Church of England hath paid dear for her indulgence in this thing; Nothing hath been more detrimental to the peace, order, and government of the Church; than the preaching of theſe youngſters, who not being rightly biaſs'd at their firſt ſetting out, through the fervour of youth, and ſome youthful luſts, as pride, vain glory, popularity, have often faln into the ſnare of the Devil, and proved deſperate Sect-Maſters, trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105369:34"/>of Schiſm and Sedition. If any have eſcaped this <hi>Charybdis,</hi> yet they have daſh'd their foot againſt another <hi>Scilla,</hi> through their ungroundedneſs and unskilfulneſs in Divinity; for howſoever young men may be of pregnant parts, excell in ſubordinate Arts and Sciences, yet for want of years and maturity of judgment, they cannot be maſters of ſuch a ſound body of Divinity, as is requiſite for the undertaking ſo weighty a province. Divinity is a vaſt and comprehenſive Science, full of depths and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundities; a great part of it Polemical; the very Practicals incumbred with many difficulties. Beſides, to the right interpretation of Scripture, a duty incumbent on the Preacher, there is required acquaintance with the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Fathers; for in a Canon of our own Church, the Expoſitions of the Fathers are to be the rule of our Expoſitions; and how can ſuch young men make this the Canon of their Interpretation, when they ſcarce know their Names, much leſs are converſant in their Writings? As every Man is not fit to make a Scholar, no more is every Scholar fit to make a Preacher. Men ſhould be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines before they are Preachers; and to be Divines there is time, and pains, and maturity of judgment required. Whereupon S. <hi>Jerom</hi> adviſeth his friends <hi>Nepotian</hi> and <hi>Pammachius, diu diſcere</hi> before they did <hi>docere.</hi> He tells <hi>Nepotian, De vita Cleric.

He admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth <hi>Ruſticus</hi> the Monk, <hi>Si clericatus titillat de ſiderium, diſce quod poſs is docere, ne miles antequam tyro, ne priùs magiſter ſis quàm diſcipulus:</hi> If the deſire of being a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-man tickled him, he ſhould learn himſelf what to teach others, leſt he ſhould take upon him to be a ſouldier before he handled a weapon, and a maſter before he was a ſcholar.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:105369:35"/>Anciently it was required men ſhould be Divines before they were Preachers, but ſince men have turned Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers before they were Divines, their Preaching hath been but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a backward forwarding of the matter; though Preaching hath gained, yet Religion hath loſt, and people have been led aſide into Sects and Factions. It was a memorable paſſage that <hi>Eraſmus</hi> relates of S. <hi>Jerom</hi> in his Life; S. <hi>Jerom</hi> once undertook to interpret allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically the Prophecy of <hi>Obadiah,</hi> when he did not himſelf underſtand the literal meaning of it; this Comment of his was by many very highly extoll'd, when he himſelf was aſhamed to own it; whereupon afterwards he writes thus merrily of himſelf, <hi>Fateor miratus ſum, quod quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumvis aliquis malè ſcripſerit, invenit ſimilem ſui lectorem. Ille praedicabat, ego erubeſcebam; ille my ſticos ſenſus fere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat ad coelum, &amp;c.</hi> I confeſs I wonder, that though a man writes never ſo ill, yet he finds a Reader like himſelf. He highly commended it, I bluſh'd at it; he extoll'd the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical ſenſe unto the skies, I hung my head and ſecretly condemn'd it. What he ingenuouſly acknowledged of his juvenile Writings, young Preachers may of their youthful Sermons. It was the ſaying of a reverend Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of this Church, <hi>Young Divines muſt have young Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity:</hi> And though young Divines have the luck to be Men-pleaſers, yea and Women-pleaſers too; yet young Divinity will never conduce to the peace and happineſs of Gods Church, no nor to the edification of men in piety and holineſs. It is the obſervation of His Sacred Majeſty in his Letter to the Lords Grace of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> That 'tis the work of young Divines and Miniſters, either out of a ſpirit of contention and contradiction, or in a vain often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their Learning, to embroil the Church and State. And we have found it true by experience: for as we read of a great King deſtroyed by the counſel of young men, ſo
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:105369:35"/>we may remember a great and good King alſo deſtroyed by theſe young Divines and their young Divinity.</p>
            <p>A third Innovation (as I take it) is the Preaching of Lecturers: but by Lecturers I do not underſtand all that go under that name, but ſuch as are merely of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſetting up, againſt the mind and without the ſpecial Licenſe of the Governours of the Church. Theſe Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers are a new order of Eccleſiaſticks, that like <hi>Carteſius</hi> Philoſophy are made up of rare Principles, but all No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties.</p>
            <p>Their Ordination (if they have any) is a Novelty; for 'tis either by Presbyters <hi>ſine Epiſcopo,</hi> or by Biſhops <hi>ſine titulo.</hi> If it be by Presbyters without a Biſhop, 'tis a Novelty, as being againſt Tradition Apoſtolical, the Practice and Conſtitution of the ancient Church, and of the univerſal Church for the ſpace of 1500. years after Chriſt. Ordination ever was the Biſhops peculiar; and all Ordinations without the Biſhop were eſteemed unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical, and pronounced null and void; <hi>Vide Concil. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinop.</hi> 1. <hi>can.</hi> 6. If it be by Biſhops without a Title, 'tis a Novelty too, againſt a Canon of our own Churhc, <hi>can.</hi> 33. and againſt the Canons of the ancient Church, <hi>Nullum abſolutè ordinaridebere Presbyterum, &amp;c. Concil. Chalced. can.</hi> 6. No Presbyter is abſolutely to be ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And I doubt ſuch a Lecture of the peoples ſetting up will never prove a Title in Law nor in the Churches eſteem; and if it be not, their Ordination is a Novelty and a Nullity alſo.</p>
            <p>Their Congregation is a Novelty, as being againſt the Doctrine, Practice and Canons of the ancient Church too, by which no Presbyter is ſuffered to hold Meetings or Conventions by himſelf contrary to the Biſhops mind and order. We find it very early in the Canons of the Apoſtles; <hi>Si quis Presbyter contemnens Epiſcopum ſuum
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105369:36"/>ſeorſim collegerit, &amp; altare aliud erexerit, nihil habens quod reprehendat Epiſcopum ſuum in cauſa pietat is &amp; juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae, deponatur, quaſi principatus amator exiſtens; eſt enim tyrannus, &amp; caeteri clerici, quicun<expan>
                     <am>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> tali conſentiunt, depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantur, laici verò ſegregentur. Can.</hi> 32. If any Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſpiſing his Biſhop ſhall hold a Meeting by himſelf, and erect another Altar, having nothing in the mean time to accuſe the Biſhop of in matter of piety and juſtice, let him be depoſed as one that loves Preeminence; for he is a Tyrant, and other Clergy-men that joyn with him are to be depoſed, and the Laicks excommunicate. To this agrees a Canon of the Council of <hi>Carthage, Si quis Presbyter ab Epiſcopo ſuo correptus, tumore vel ſuperbia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flatus, putaverit ſeparatim ſacrificia Deo offerenda, vel aliud erigendum altare centra eccle ſiaſbicam fidem, vel diſciplinam crediderit, non exeat impunitùs:</hi> If any Presbyter being rebuked and cenſured by the Biſhop, ſhall in a ſeparation offer ſacrifice to God, or erect another Altar againſt the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Faith and Diſcipline, let him not go unpuniſh'd. But theſe Lecturers hold Conventions and Meetings in the Church without the Biſhops Licenſe, and againſt the Canons of the Church, and all Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline; therefore their Congregation is a Novelty.</p>
            <p>Their Election is a Novelty, as being by the ſuffrage of the People onely; though ſometimes the Biſhops anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently did conſult the People before their Ordination, <hi>ad te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonium,</hi> for their teſtimony; yet never <hi>ad electionem,</hi> for their ſuffrage in the choice of them: much leſs after Ordination did they leave it to the People to make choice of their own Curates, but they themſelves appointed and ſent out fit men to their ſeveral Cures. There are ſeveral Canons wherein the People are barr'd this liberty of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the ancient Church: the 13. <hi>can.</hi> of the Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> may ſerve alone to give us a taſte; <hi>Non eſt popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105369:36"/>concedendum Electionem facere corum, qui altaris mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterio ſunt applicandi.</hi> It is not to be left to the people to make choice of thoſe, who are to ſerve at the altar. But theſe Lecturers come in all by popular Election, and maintain the peoples election an authentick Call and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient without any Miſsion or Commiſsion from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop; and therefore their Election is a Novelty.</p>
            <p>Their Maintenance is a Novelty, as being Elemoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of the peoples benevolence; they live not upon any Church revenue of tithes, or glebe, or oblations, but upon the peoples contributions. Whereas the maintenance of the Clergy was ever of tithes, or ſome Church revenue, or before the ſettlement of tithes by ſecular powers, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain honourable ſtipends diſtributed at the diſcretion of the Biſhop, according to the merits of the perſon, weekly or monthly out of the Churches treaſure, whereupon Presbyters were call'd by St. <hi>Cyprian, Sportulantes fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres, Epiſt.</hi> 66. and thoſe ſtipends <hi>ſportulae, Epiſt.</hi> 34. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terum Presbyterii honorem nos deſignaſse illis jam ſciatis, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

As amongſt the Romanes, the word <hi>ſportulae</hi> was uſed for a certain allowance of food or mony given by great men to their followers; ſo in Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> it ſignifies the allowance or ſtipends which the Biſhop out of the Church treaſure paid to the Prieſts that depended upon him. For as the Churches treaſure was ſolely at the Biſhops diſpoſing; ſo the Clergy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon the Biſhop for their maintainance out of that treaſure. And therefore tis provided in the 7 <hi>Can.</hi> of the Council of <hi>Gangres, Siquis oblationes eccleſiae accipere, vel dare voluerit praeter conſcientiam Epiſcopi, vel ejus cui hujusmodi officia commiſſa ſunt, nec cum ejus voluerit age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

And therefore their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance is a novelty.</p>
            <p>Their Doctrine is a novelty. As they are the peoples creatures, ſo they are the peoples ſervants, and take great care to pleaſe them, <hi>populo ut placerent quas feciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent fabulas;</hi> and foraſmuch as people are lovers of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties, they muſt be ſure to bring new things to their ears daily. It is not enough for them to preach <hi>novè,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a new manner, but they muſt preach <hi>nova,</hi> and not <hi>bona nova</hi> but <hi>mala nova;</hi> nay <hi>nova mala,</hi> new Gods in Iſrael; <hi>nova dogmata ſunt novi dii</hi> (ſaith <hi>Vineentius</hi>) new opinions are new Gods; And if theſe be not new opinions, new doctrines; That the government of the Church by Biſhops is Antichriſtian; That murdering of Kings is lawful; That Rebellion and Schiſm are no ſins; That Chriſts Goſpel, as <hi>Mahumetaniſm,</hi> is to be propagated by the Sword; That the greateſt diſturbers and violaters of the publick peace, are the onely Saints, and moſt godly Men, Let them that know any thing of antiquity judge; And yet this is the Syſteme of their Divinity.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, they themſelves are the greateſt Novelty of all. I find no order of Clergy-men in former times that reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles them, but the <hi>Mendicant Fryars</hi> in the Romane Church, an order ſet up by St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> and St. <hi>Francis</hi> about the time of <hi>Innocent the third,</hi> and <hi>Innocent the fourth</hi> Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and with them they hold cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency in two things, As the <hi>Mendicant Friars</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exempted from the juriſdiction of Biſhops, brought
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105369:37"/>the Biſhops into contempt with the people: ſo theſe Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturers exempting themſelves from the juriſdiction of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, do all they can to the diminution of their Order, and honour, that they may become the ſcorn of the vulgar. As the <hi>Mendicant Fryers</hi> having Charters from the Pope to preach in every Pariſh, without the licenſe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Curate; to take confeſsions, to viſit the ſick, and bury the dead; rendred the ſecular Clergy contemptible, and by that means brought all the Griſt to their own Mills: ſo theſe Lecturers by their induſtrious preaching of novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties bring the regular Clergy, who live in ſubordination to the King, and the Biſhops, into contempt with the people. But as <hi>omne ſimile eſt etiam diſſimile,</hi> though theſe <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicant Fryers</hi> were in ſome things exorbitant, yet in the main they were true and faithful to the intereſt of the Church: But theſe Lecturers are ever falſe, and perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Church that gave them Chriſtendom; ever bandying publickly againſt her Doctrine and Diſcipline, or undermining privately her walls, and bulwarks. An army of Turks could not have made a greater devaſtation in the Church, and Nation, than they did of late by their ſeditious Doctrines. They poiſoned all the corporations of England with their principles of Schiſm, and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. They blew the trumpets to war in the pulpit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were ſounded in the field. When they could not ſlay their two enemies, Kingſhip and Epiſcopacy, <hi>gladio or is,</hi> with the Sword of their mouth, they did it <hi>ore gladii,</hi> with the edge of the Sword. They are ever at defiance with their lawfull ſuperiours, but damnable flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the people, and verifie that maxim of <hi>Tertullian, nuſquam mag is proficitur, quam in caſtris rebellium, ubi eſſe eſt promereri.</hi> There is no ſuch proficiency as in the tents of Schiſmaticks, where the very being is meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. If any will but follow them and hear their Lectures,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105369:38"/>they canonize them for Saints before they are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and make them ſure of ſalvation, before they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the firſt principles of the oracles of God; in a word, they are the falſe Prophets of the Nation, by whom God tries us whether we will love him, or obey him as we ought to do, and whom he forbids us to harken unto; for though they come to us in Sheeps-clothing, yet inwardly they are ravening Wolves. <hi>Gulielmus de Sancto Amore,</hi> a Learned <hi>Theologue,</hi> who lived about the firſt riſing of theſe <hi>Mendicant Fryars,</hi> writ a Book upon that occaſion <hi>de periculis Eccleſiae,</hi> and in that a Treatiſe, <hi>de ſignis pſeudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prophetarum.</hi> If any will take the pains to read over that treatiſe, which he may find tranſcribed, and tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the book of Martyrs, he ſhall find that in moſt of them, they agree to theſe Lecturers. O that people would but ſee their ſin and danger in following ſuch falſe lights! O that theſe deceivers would conſider of the judgments of God threatned againſt them, for abuſing of the people, renting of the Church, and embroyling of the State; And at laſt become obedient Sons of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Mother, the Church, that we might all ſay and ſing, <hi>quam bonum, et quam jucundum.</hi>
